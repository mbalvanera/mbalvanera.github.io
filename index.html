		<ul>
			<li>
				<a target="_blank" href="https://www.typographicposters.com/"><u>Typographic Posters</u></a>
			</li>
			<p>This page has been a constant source for inspiration, not only with the graphic poster features but with the way the grid is completly modular and the side scrolling for each page. The webstite was founded and developed by <a target="blank" href="http://andrefelipe.com/">Andr√© Felipe</a>

				<a target="_blank" href="http://valerievanzuijlen.com/"><u> Valerie Van Zuijlen</u></a>
			</li>
			<p> Valerie is a graphic desinger/web artist I had the pleasure of meeting during a workshop in Mexico City. Her internet based art could only fit in an internet based web portfolio which makes really interesting us of some javascript features. She probably designed it herself on a platorform called Berta.me.

				<a target="_blank" href="http://thenormalstudio.com/"><u>The Normal Studio</u></a>
			</li>
			<p>The Normal Studio is a design collective working in Chicago and Los Angeles. Their website is a fluid mix between simple and cpmplex, both in the user experience as in the featured worked that go together.

		<h1>Sites I Dislike</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a targte="_blank" href="http://www.trendlist.org/"><u>The Trend List</u></a>
			</li>
			<p>This website creates a sort of database for trends within graphic design. While the concept of what they do is problematic in itself I think the design is hard to use, unorganized and unflattering. This is due to the following factors:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>The font size which creates a lack of hierarchy</li>
				<li>The use of only one color</li>
				<li>There is no defined grid for the features</li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
